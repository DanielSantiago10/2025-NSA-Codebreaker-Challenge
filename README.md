# NSA Codebreaker Challenge – Project Overview
## Overview

The NSA Codebreaker Challenge is a nationally recognized, annual cybersecurity competition designed to simulate real-world intelligence and cyber defense scenarios. Participants are tasked with solving a series of increasingly complex, sequential challenges, each unlocking only after the previous task is completed.

Challenges are scored based on difficulty, with teams ranked by the total points earned across all completed tasks. Solutions may be submitted at any point during the competition window, but success requires persistence, adaptability, and a strong analytical mindset.

Each task calls on a wide range of skills, including technical analysis, logical reasoning, intuition, and common sense. Rather than focusing on isolated tools, the challenge emphasizes thinking like a cyber analyst and learning how to operate in uncertain, high-stakes environments.

## Scenario Background

This year’s Codebreaker Challenge placed participants inside a fictional national security scenario involving suspected nation-state adversaries targeting U.S. military cyber operations.

Within the narrative, unusual activity detected by a Department of the Air Force Security Operations Center (DAFIN-SOC) prompted a Request for Information (RFI) to the NSA. Participants assumed the role of a new analyst assigned to the NSA Cyber Response Team, tasked with identifying threats, validating intelligence, and defending U.S. cyber interests against a sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

## Personal Journey

Participating in the NSA Codebreaker Challenge pushed me well outside my comfort zone and challenged me to operate under ambiguity—much like a real-world cybersecurity or intelligence analyst.

Throughout the challenge, I was required to:

Form and test assumptions with limited information

Adapt quickly when an approach failed

Validate findings instead of forcing an answer

Think critically about why something worked or didn’t

While my run ended earlier than I had hoped, the experience was incredibly valuable. It reinforced that cybersecurity is not just about knowing tools or commands, but about reasoning through uncertainty, learning from failure, and continuously improving analytical judgment.

I’m proud to share that I was one of only four students at Southern New Hampshire University to advance past Level 1 out of 7. While that is not the finish line, it was a humbling and motivating reminder of how deep and demanding this field truly is—and how much there still is to learn.

Team & Community Milestones

## 🎉 CyberSNHUpers – National Performance

Represented Southern New Hampshire University as part of the CyberSNHUpers team

Competed against 529 teams nationwide

Finished 38th overall, reflecting significant effort, collaboration, and resilience

This experience highlighted the power of community and teamwork. I’m incredibly grateful to Angela Pope, our club president, and the student leadership team for consistently finding meaningful competitions and hands-on projects that push us to grow beyond the classroom.

## Lessons Learned

This challenge reinforced several key lessons that will directly influence my future work in cybersecurity:

Ambiguity is the norm: Real-world cyber problems rarely come with clear instructions or guaranteed solutions.

Failure is a data point: Incorrect paths still provide insight and help refine the next approach.

Analytical thinking matters more than tools: Knowing why something works is more important than simply knowing how.

Persistence beats perfection: Progress often comes from iteration, not immediate success.

Continuous learning is essential: Every challenge revealed gaps in my knowledge—and motivation to close them.

## Final Reflection

The NSA Codebreaker Challenge was more than a competition—it was a realistic preview of the mindset required for a career in cybersecurity and national defense. It challenged my assumptions, strengthened my analytical skills, and reaffirmed my passion for continuous learning and growth in this field.

Grateful for the experience
